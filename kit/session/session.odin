package kit_session

// kit/session — player identity and the shared roster: who is in this run,
// under which stable Player_Id, connected or not. The session core of the
// friendslop toolkit (phase 1), grown from the acid test's session node.
//
// THE IDENTITY MODEL: a player IS a reconnect token — a random u64 secret the
// client generates once and persists (the game saves it; the tests pass it in).
// The host maps token → Player_Id forever: reconnecting with the same token —
// from a NEW transport peer, after a crash, mid-game — reclaims the same id,
// and with it (in later bricks) name, stats, and owned entities. Player_Ids
// are never derived from transport peer ids, which is what makes reconnect
// (and post-v1 host migration) possible at all. Departed players stay in the
// roster as disconnected for exactly this reason.
//
// ENGINE-FREE, like kit/net: the game script owns the sockets and the framing.
// The contract is three hookups —
//   * send:            the session hands complete message bytes + a target
//                      peer to the game, which prefixes ITS session kind byte
//                      and ships them on the reliable channel (kit/netgd).
//   * handle_packet:   the game routes its session kind byte back here.
//   * peer up/down:    the game forwards the transport's connect/disconnect
//                      signals (session join is a JOIN message, not a socket
//                      event — a connected-but-never-joined peer is nobody).
// Everything the game needs to REACT to comes out of one event queue, drained
// per frame (session_poll) — no callbacks into half-initialized script state.
//
// v1 has no host migration: the host vanishing ends the run (Ev_Host_Left —
// the game shows its "run over" screen). Backup-host snapshots (a later
// brick) keep the door open.
